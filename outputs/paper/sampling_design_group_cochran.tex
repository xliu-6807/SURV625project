\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

The State of Michigan Department of Education (MDE) requires data to
monitor teenage smoking and drug use, partly to assess compliance with
tobacco industry settlements. This report details the design of a
statewide probability sample of Michigan teenagers (enrolled students in
grades 7-12) developed to meet the Department's needs. The objective was
to create a cost-effective sample design capable of producing estimates
for key variables with desired mean and sampling variance for both the
state overall and each of the nine official school regions. Based on
cost considerations and a review of alternatives, a two-stage
school-based sample design was chosen by the client. We outline in this
report the overall design, stratification and allocation plan, selection
procedures, and estimation methods. Our budget consist of a total of
\$500,000; each school \(C_n\) cost \$3,000 and each student \(C_m\)
cost \$50 to sample.\\

The MDE is specifically interested in three outcome variables; every
smoked one cigarette, every smoked marijuana, and age when first
approach to smoke cigarettes or marijuana. Moreover, they provided us
with expected levels of precision for the survey in terms of the
expected means and coefficient of variation (CV=0.05) which can be seen
in Table 1.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\caption{Key Variables and Desired Levels of Precision}\tabularnewline

smoked\_mj & prop & 0.05 & 0.15 \\
age\_approached & mean & 0.05 & 12.00 \\
\end{longtable}

Given the desired levels of precision, we can compute the desired simple
random sample (SRS) sample sizes when CV =.05 as
\(n = \frac{s^2}{se^2}\). We first must calculate the element variance
for each key variable. For proportions we use \(\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\),
while for age we simply just square the estimated standard deviation of
1 that was given to us, \(v(\bar{y}) = \sigma^2\). We then calculate the
standard error as \(se(\hat{p}) = CV \times \hat{p}\). Finally, we
estimate the desired sampling variance as
\(var(\hat{p}) =  se(\hat{p})^2 \text{, where }  se(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{var(\hat{p})}\).
We show these results in Table 2, and note that these desired levels of
precision would lead to large differences in sample sizes for each
target variable. Therefore, we may wish to consider a more complex
survey design.

\section{Sampling Design}\label{sec-meth}

We propose a two-stage stratified cluster sampling as a complex survey
sampling method for this project combining stratification with
multi-stage cluster sampling. First, the entire population is divided
into mutually exclusive and collectively exhausted subgroups called
strata, based on shared characteristics relevant to the study (e.g.,
geographic region). Then, within each of these strata, the first stage
of sampling occurs: a random sample of clusters (natural groupings like
schools) is selected, and are called primary sampling unts (PSUs). In
the second stage, a random sample of individual elements known as
secondary sampling units (SSUs), such as students, are drawn from within
each of the clusters selected in the first stage. This approach aims to
improve sample efficiency and representation by ensuring subgroups are
included (i.e., stratification) while reducing costs and logistical
challenges associated with sampling individuals across large geographic
areas.

The MDE has given us the 2024 7th through 12th grade student headcount
for each public and private school within each of the nine regions
resulting in a target frame of \(830,138\) across \(2,443\) schools
(78\% Public). Schools in the first stage will be selected with
probability proportional to student body size (PPeS). The proportionate
allocation \(M_h / \sum M_h\) where \(M_h\) is the total number of
students in stratum \(h\), will be used to determine school number
selection in the first stage. Table 3 presents for each of the 9 strata
total students, number of schools, and proportionate allocation.

We obtained design effects (DEFF) estimates (DEFF\_cig=2.5,
DEFF\_mj=2.0, DEFF\_age=1.7) from a similar pilot study of 7,500
students based on on 150 schools with 50 students each, and based on
these we estimate the rate of homogeneity \(roh\) for each target
variable. We use the provided DEFFs to estimate \(roh\) as
\(\hat{roh} = \frac{DEFF-1}{m-1}\), where \(m\) is the total sampled
students in the pilot study, to consider alternative cluster sample
designs along with cost-considerations. Table 4 provides the \(roh\)
estimate for each target variable.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Sampling Within
Budget}}{Sampling Within Budget}}\label{sampling-within-budget}

Recall that our budget cost constraints as the cost per cluster as
\(c_n = \$3,000\) and cost per student as \(c_m = \$50\), with a total
budget constraint of \(C = \$500,000\). We can use the \(roh\)estimates
along with these costs to estimate the optimum subsample size
\(m_{opt}\) needed to achieve the desired precision as
\(m_{opt} = \sqrt{\frac{c_n}{c_m} \frac{1-roh}{roh}}\). Note that since
we have three target variables we also have three separate \(roh\)
estimates and thus three \(m_{opt}\) estimates. Similarly, we can use
\(m_{opt}\) to estimate the number of schools \(n_{opt}\) to sample,
\(n_{opt} = \frac{C}{c_n + m_{opt} \times c_m}\) . Finally, we compute
new DEFF for each variable as \(roh\) is portable and since we already
computed \(m_{opt}\) as \(DEFF_{new} = 1 + (m_{opt} - 1) \times roh\).
By multiplying \(m_{opt} \times n_{opt}\) for each variable we also get
the total subsample size, as well as compute the total cost using
\(n_{opt} \times c_n + n_{opt} \times m_{opt} \times c_m\). Table 5
shows for each target variable \(m_{opt}\), \(n_{opt}\), \(DEFF_{new}\),
total subsample size denoted by \(total_{nm}\), and the total cost.
Notice that our \(DEFF_{new}\) estimates are close to those from the
pilot study since again we used these to compute \(roh\) which is
portable for estimating new design effects.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Evaluating Alternative Clustering
Designs}}{Evaluating Alternative Clustering Designs}}\label{evaluating-alternative-clustering-designs}

We are left with a dilemma since we now have three subsample sizes that
we can use, thus giving us three clustering design options to choose
from. Using the \(m_{opt}\) values from table 5 as our three options, we
iterate over each set of three target variables using these values to
recompute for each target variable a new design effect and evaluate the
estimated sampling variance for each design. We estimate the SRS
sampling variance as \(var_{srs} = \frac{var}{total_{nm} - 1}\) where
var is the sampling variance calculated from the pilot study and the
denominator is the degrees of freedom. Additionally, we estimate the
sampling variance for the clustering design as
\(var_{crs} = var_{srs} \times deff_{new}\). After estimating
\(var_{crs}\), we can square it to estimate a standard error,
\(se=\sqrt{var_{crs}}\) to use to estimate 95\% confidence intervals for
the estimated means. Additionally, in our evaluation of \(m_{opt}\) we
can determine if the estimated sampling variance from the complex design
is smaller than what is desired from MDE, therefore Table 6 shows
sampling variances, standard errors, confidence intervals, and a
variance check (e.g., ``Y'' = yes if \textless= to desired sampling
variance) for each target variable using the \(m_{opt}\) options in
Table 5.

\end{longtable}

Upon evaluation of options from Table 6, we determine that option 2 has
reasonable estimated design effects comparable to those from the pilot
study as well as it is the only option to pass the estimated sampling
variance check we designed. Option 2 with \(m_{opt} = 53, n_{opt} = 88\)
would cost a total of \$497,200. Since the total student population is
830138 and our now target sample is 4721 we can estimate the sampling
fraction to be \(f = n/N\) = 0.0056874. The sampling fraction is the
ratio of the sample size to the population size, and this estimate
translates to the sample comprises approximately 0.57\% of the total
student population. In this case, the sampling fraction is low and the
finite population correction factor is not needed for calculating
variances to adjust for the fact that sampling without replacement from
a finite population reduces variability compared to sampling from an
infinite population.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Non-response
Adjustments}}{Non-response Adjustments}}\label{non-response-adjustments}

The MDE anticipates 30\% school response rates and 70\% among students;
therefore, we adjust the number of schools and within-school target by
multiplying \(m_{opt} \times RR_{student} = 53 \times .70\) = 76.6651878
students and for schools \(n_{opt} \times RR_{schools} =  \times .30\) =
293.2578028. We use these values to allocate the number of clusters for
each strata based on the proportion allocated we calculated.

\section{Stage 1 Selection}\label{stage-1-selection}

We consider stratified PPeS selection of schools from each strata by
first sorting the list of schools to achieve implicit stratification.
How we sort is by taking the number of 9th through 12th grade for each
school divided by the total student body and descend order, and in this
way we hypothesize that schools with older students are more likely to
be positively associated with the target variables. For each strata
\(h\) we assign our adjusted
\(n_{opt} \times proportionate \_ allocation\) estimated earlier to
calculate the number of schools to sample, denoted as \(n_h\) in Table
7. We use \(n_h\) to calculated in this Table the sampling interval
\(k_h = \frac{\sum_{i \ in h} MOS_{hi}}{n_h}\) where \(MOS_{hi}\) is the
measure of size (MOS), total student head-count, for each school \(i\)
in strata \(h\). The \(k_h\) parameter is an important component of
systematic sampling to determine how frequently units are selected from
an ordered list. To conduct this selection, we randomly select a number
between 1 and \(k_h\) for selecting schools from the list, which is
captured in Table 7 as \(RN\).

For each strata we use the random start to select the first school, and
for stratum with more than one selection we use
\(RN, RN+k_h, RN+2k_h,...,RN +(n_h-1)\) until we satisfy \(n_h\)
selection. Our minimum MOS 76.67 is also our \(m_{opt}\) and we use it
here to determine the minimum number of students in each selected school
required and if this is not satisfy we perform post-selection linkage.
The linking is done by first selecting the number of schools in each
strata. When the next units on the list do not meet the sufficient MOS
size required we move forward in the list until the first unit that
meets the minimum requirement is achieved. For all the units that did
not meet the requirement they are cumulated backwards until a linked
unit of minimum sufficient size is created. We do this process for all
strata. Table 8 shows for each strata the total number of clusters, how
many totaled schools linked and the total number of students.

\section{Stage 2 Selection}\label{stage-2-selection}

To maintain equal probability of selection (epsem) across all strata, we
computed the required number of students to be sampled per selected
school, denoted as \(m^*_h\) , based on the within-strata sampling
fraction \(f_h\), which is the same as the overall sampling fraction
\(f\) for all \(h\), and the stratum-specific PPS sampling interval
\(k_h\) as follows:

\[
f_h = \frac{n_h MOS_{hi} }{\sum,_{i \in h} MOS{hi} } \frac{m^*_h}{MOS_{hi}}
 = \frac{n_h m^*_h}{\sum_{e \in h}} = m^*_h = f \times k_h
\]

This ensures that when each school is selected with probability
proportional to its MOS and then students are sampled within school at a
fixed rate \(\frac{m^*_h}{MOS_{hi}}\), the overall inclusion probability
for any student is:

\[
\pi_{i} = \frac{n_h \times MOS_{hi}}{\sum MOS_{hi}} \times \frac{m^*_h}{MOS_{hi}} = \frac{n_h m^*_h}{\sum MOS_h} 
\]Each student has the same selection probability within the state and
within region \(h\), satisfying the epsem condition.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Undersized Schools
Linking}}{Undersized Schools Linking}}\label{undersized-schools-linking}

In cases where a selected school had fewer students than the desired
cluster size \(m^*_h\), the within-school sampling rate would exceed
1.0, making the design unfeasible. To address this, and to ensured that
the effective number of completed questionnaires per school meets the
targets \(m^*_h\), we linked undersized schools with nearby schools when
their MOS was less than \(\frac{m^*_h}{r}\), where \(r\) is the expected
student response rate (70\%). This operational rule preserves
feasibility without altering theoretical inclusion probabilities. The
within-school sampling rate remains \(\frac{m^*_h}{MOS_{hi}}\),
maintaining epsem across students. For example, 5 small schools in
Region 4 were linked to form a cluster of 10th meeting the required
sample size of 19.729. Table 9 shows the calculated \(m^*_h\), the
number of expected students, and the epsem validation for each of the
nine regions. These totals confirm that the expected completed sample
size (sum ≈ 4,721) aligns with the original plan, and the design remains
epsem-compliant across all regions.

\section{Estimation Plan}\label{estimation-plan}

For this proposal, we use the paired selection model to help us estimate
variance. However, we cannot form a pseudo-stratum from just one cluster
nor have odd number of clusters, since paired methods require at least
tow units within a stratum. A key constraint for this approach is that
each stratum must contain at least two independent variance units. We
collapse stratum that have odd number clusters or just one cluster with
the adjacent stratum. In Table 10 we show collapsed strata and
corresponding number of sampling error computation units (SECU); we
collapsed regions 1 to 3 into stratum 1, regions 4 to 7 into stratum 2,
and left regions 8 and 9 the same. We take all of the linked clusters
and divide them by two to get the paired SECU count. We now have a total
of 4 strata in this model, 3 SECUs for stratum 1, 103 SECUS for stratum
2, 77 SECUS for stratum 3, and 135 SECUs for stratum 4 resulting in a
total of 318 SECUs across strata. In our estimation plan, each sampled
unit (student) is assigned a stratum code indicating the explicit
sampling stratum from which its PSU (clusters) was drawn.

\emph{Variance Estimation}

In this study, we need to estimate the proportion who have ever smoked,
the proportion who have ever used marijuana, and the mean age at first
use of cigarettes or marijuana. We did not consider using weight here
since we maintain epsem design through the whole sampling process, which
means every student has the same probability of being selected. However,
in practice, we need to consider the response rate(the response rate
among schools will be 30 percent, and the response rate among teenagers
within schools will be 70 percent), which we should adjust our weight in
design based on the response rate when conducting variance estimation.
We decided to use Taylor Series Linearization to estimate the ratio
estimator, which is approximated as: \(\text{For all strata } n_h = 2\)

\[
\text{var}(r) \approx \frac{1}{\hat{t}_x^2} \left[ \sum_h \text{var}(\hat{t}_{h,y}) + r^2 \sum_h \text{var}(\hat{t}_{h,x}) - 2r \sum_h \text{cov}(\hat{t}_{h,y}, \hat{t}_{h,x}) \right]
\]

The general estimator used is the ratio estimator:
\(\hat{r} = \frac{\hat{t}_y}{\hat{t}_x}\)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\hat{t}_y\): estimated total for the numerator variable(e.g., number
  of students who smoked)
\item
  \(\hat{t}_x\): estimated total for the denominator(e.g., total
  eligible students)
\item
  \(\text{var}(\hat{t}_{h,y})\): variance of the numerator total within
  stratum \(h\)
\item
  \(\text{var}(\hat{t}_{h,x})\):variance of the denominator total within
  stratum \(h\)
\item
  \(\text{cov}(\hat{t}{h,y}, \hat{t}{h,x})\): covariance between
  numerator and denominator totals within stratum \(h\)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Confidence
Interval}}{Confidence Interval}}\label{confidence-interval}

A 95\% confidence interval for the estimated proportion and mean
\(\hat{r}\) is given by:
\(\hat{r} \pm t_{df, 0.975} \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{r})\), where,
\(SE(\hat{r}) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat{r})}\), and the df is equal to the
number of SECUs minus the number of strata, which is 318-4 = 314. We
conducted a simulation of the variance estimation of the proportion of
students who ever smoked by applying the variance estimation formula,
and we got: Ratio Estimator = 0.2505455, SE = 0.00003422286, 95\%
confidence interval {[}0.2504782, 0.2506129{]}.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Subclass
Estimation}}{Subclass Estimation}}\label{subclass-estimation}

For the 20\% subgroup, we used the same estimation and variance
formulas, but applied them to a subset of the data that reflects 20\% of
the full population(lower-income households). However, the low-income
students are only 20\% of the population, which means some SECUs may
contain a very small number of low-income students or no low-income
students, thus, not meet the expected subclass size per cluster (
\(\text{expected }b^* \text{subclass pct} = 76.66519 \times 0.20 = 15.33304\)).
In that case, we might link undersized units to form linked units of the
minimum sufficient size. We print the roaster of names in the Appendix
to save space here.

In conclusion, this report details a robust and statistically efficient
two-stage stratified cluster sampling design tailored to the MDE's need
for monitoring teenage smoking and drug use. By employing stratification
across educational regions, probability proportional to size selection
for schools, and systematic sampling of students within schools, the
design ensures representative statewide and regional estimates while
adhering to budget constraints. The chosen parameters, including an
anticipated sample of approximately 88 schools and 4,721 students, are
optimized to achieve the required precision for key variables after
accounting for anticipated non-response. The outlined procedures for
selection, including linkage for smaller schools, and the comprehensive
estimation plan provide a clear roadmap for survey implementation and
analysis, ultimately delivering a cost-effective solution capable of
generating the critical data required by the MDE.
